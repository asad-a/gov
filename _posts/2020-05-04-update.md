## May 4, 2020

* $850M investment in Canadian and [international](https://europa.eu/global-response/) projects to research, develop and test treatments and vaccines for COVID-19
* It's the 75th anniversary of the Canadian-led liberation of the Netherlands - asks us all to pause for a moment of silence at 2:00 PM EST
* Working on how the relief programs (CERB, etc.) will change once Canadians start re-entering workforce - more details soon
* Did not commit to tabling a Budget this year - "we're still in a period of tremendous uncertainty and we'll continue to be transparent"
* Specific sectoral support for the economy (ex: airlines) will be announced in the coming days/weeks
