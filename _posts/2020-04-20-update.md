## April 20, 2020

### PM Trudeau

* "We stand with you, we grieve with you, and you can count on our government's full support" re: Nova Scotia shooting
* A virtual vigil will take place this Friday at 7:00 PM on Facebook. Asked the media to not mention the name or show the picture of the man responsible for the attack - "do not give him the gift of infamy, let's focus our attention on the lives we lost."
* Said if it weren't for the pandemic they would have already introduced legislation to ban assault weapons. They will do so ASAP

### Ontario Premier Ford

* Thanks to our collective efforts we've avoided the worst case scenario - total cases now expected to be around 20k (originally was 80k)
* New modelling shows COVID-19 has peaked and "is coming under control," but is growing in long-term care and other congregate settings
* They're working on a framework to open up the economy in a slow and methodical way (will follow advice from Chief Medical Officer)
* "I'd rather wait and be safe than opening up the economy. That's the number one priority." (he will not provide a firm date for this reason)
* "When we do turn on the economy, it's going to be a trickle. Every two weeks we'll do a little bit more and a little bit more"

### Qu√©bec Premier Legault

* Schools are unlikely to re-open for May 4th as they need at least two weeks of preparation to make that happen but, daycare facilities may open earlier than schools
* Aiming to stabilize the crisis in long-term care facilities by having the over 2000 medical professionals who have stepped forward work in theses institutions for at least two weeks
* 125 military personnel are now working in 5 long-term care facilities in the greater Montreal area
* Residential construction has resumed for projects scheduled to be completed for July 31st
* Non-essential businesses are still to remain closed until May 5th but re-opening businesses won't happen all at once. The Premier emphasized a gradual and staggered approach
