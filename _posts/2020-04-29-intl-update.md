## International: April 29, 2020

* Analysis from UN agency the International Labour Organisation has found [1.6 billion people's livelihoods are threatened by the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52474849), equivalent to almost half the global workforce.
* [Japan is expected to extend state of emergency by a month](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/30/national/government-in-talks-over-extending-japans-state-of-emergency-as-covid-19-continues-to-spread/#.XqpgVahKg2w), after the Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as “severe”.
* [Coronavirus cases in Germany jump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/germany-s-new-coronavirus-cases-increase-the-most-in-four-days?srnd=premium-europe), as it was announced on Wednesday that [Germany has extended its travel ban on tourists until 14 June](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/germany-extends-ban-on-tourists-until-june/). This is after lockdown was eased somewhat last week
* [The US federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/29/end-of-social-distancing-rules-coronavirus-223505) once they expire on Thursday, leaving action to state governors. This comes as the number of American deaths surpasses 60,000, the highest of any country.
* Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious-disease expert, has said he is [optimistic about early results of a trial of drug Remdesivir](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52478783), previously developed as an Ebola treatment.
* However, [GlaxoSmithKline](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-results-vaccine/gsk-boss-sees-no-coronavirus-vaccine-mass-produced-before-mid-2021-idUSKBN22B1X0) has said the global push to develop a mass-produced coronavirus vaccine would not lead to mass-produced products before mid-2021.
* [Brazil has reported a record increase in cases](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8270115/Brazilian-city-reports-160-percent-increase-COVID-19-cases-easing-social-distancing.html), with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 78,162, as President Bolsonaro caused outrage by shrugging off the rising death toll.
* And finally, from going to bed too late thanks to endless scrolling through theories about the pandemic, to waking up in the night worrying, Covid-19 is wreaking havoc with our sleep according to a [major survey conducted](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/life-under-lockdown-coronavirus-in-the-uk) by King’s College London that showed two in five people in the UK have reported sleep disturbance with the biggest dream cluster being bugs; flying bugs attacking the dreamer, cockroaches swarming, masses of squirming worms.
