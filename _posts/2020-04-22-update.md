### PM Trudeau

* Launching the Canada Emergency Student Benefit ($9B) - eligible students will receive $1,250 per month from May to August. This increases to $1,750 if you're a student taking care of someone else or a person with disabilities. Eligible if you're in school now, will be in school in September, or graduated in December 2019. Students who have a job but make less than $1,000 will also be eligible. Payments start on May 1st
* Launching the Canada Student Service Grant - eligible students will receive $1,000 to $5,000 if they're volunteering instead of working
* Creating 76,000 jobs for young people in addition to the Summer Jobs Program - also providing targeted support for indigenous students
* $291M to extend student scholarships, fellowships, and grants for 3-4 months to allow them to continue their work
* Doubling the student grants for the 2021 school year - up to $6,000 for full-time students and up to $3,600 for part-time
* $75.2M in distinctions-based support for First Nation, Inuit & Métis Nation students pursuing post-secondary education

### Ontario Premier Ford

* Made a formal request to bring in the Canadian Forces to support 5 long-term care homes (for staffing relief, operations, general assistance)
* Specialist SWAT teams will support over 100 long-term care homes + prioritizing and distributing millions of PPE
* There is positive movement - 20 long term care homes previously with an outbreak are now free of COVID-19
* Refuted rumours he'll open the economy on May 24th (not that he won't, but can't say now) and could not confirm if the school year is over

### Québec Premier Legault

* There are still 1000 urgent unfilled positions in long-term health care centers across the province so the Premier has decided to make a request for the Canadian Forces to fill the gap immediatly
* The plan for re-opening schools will be released next week and return will be optional, parents will decide if they want to send their kids back
* The plan for non-essential businesses will also be announced next week, the approach will be gradual and region dependent
* Social distancing efforts have saved an estimated 30,000 - 70,000 lives in Quebec
* The wearing of masks in public will most likely be mandatory once the province begins to loosen social distancing measures
